![Old worn handwritten cookbook open to two old tattered pages of "Facts & Tips" and "Coding Assistant"](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bfc41c2-63e3-4e1c-8006-3bd7e69580e1)


### What is it?
Welcome to the interactive Copilot Chat cookbook! This cookbook is designed to teach you the various ways and techniques of GitHub Copilot Chat&mdash;in fact, this cookbook was modeled from our very own [Copilot Chat cookbook documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/copilot-chat-cookbook)!

### How do I start?
In this repository's _Issues_ tab, you'll find some open issues, each with a situation you are likely to encounter as advanced Copilot users. Read through the scenario, and then try to imagine how Copilot can help you solve the problem. When you're ready, open Copilot Chat on the very issue page by clicking the Copilot icon next to the search bar. Feel free to close the issue once you've used Copilot to solve the problem and master the challenge!

If you get stuck, consider the prompts provided under the **Example prompt** of each issue and how they might be different.
